/**
 * @title Timelock Authorizer
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @dev Authorizer with timelocks (delays).
 *
 * Users are allowed to perform actions if they have the permission to do so.
 *
 * This Authorizer implementation allows defining delays per action identifier. If a delay is set for an action, users
 * are not allowed to execute it directly themselves. Instead, they schedule an execution that the Authorizer will
 * run in the future.
 *
 * Glossary:
 * - Action: Operation that can be performed on a target contract. These are identified by a unique bytes32 `actionId`
 *   defined by each target contract following `IAuthentication.getActionId`.
 * - Scheduled execution: The Authorizer can define a delay for an `actionId` to require that a specific
 *   time window must pass before it can be executed. When a delay is set for an `actionId`, executions
 *   must be scheduled. These executions are identified by an unsigned integer called `scheduledExecutionId`.
 * - Permission: Accounts have or don't have permission to perform an action identified by its `actionId` on a specific
 *   contract `where`. Note that if the action has a delay, then accounts with permission cannot perform the action
 *   directly, but are instead allowed to schedule future executions for them.
 *
 * Note that the TimelockAuthorizer doesn't use reentrancy guard on its external functions.
 * The only function which makes an external non-view call (and so could initiate a reentrancy attack) is `execute`
 * which executes a scheduled execution, protected by the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
 * In fact a number of the TimelockAuthorizer's functions may only be called through a scheduled execution so reentrancy
 * is necessary in order to be able to call these.

     * Critical actions that are performed by smart contracts and to which there is a long term commitment (e.g. minting
     * of BAL as part of the Liquidity Mining Program) are typically subject to such revoke delays, making it impossible
     * to disable the system without sufficient notice.
     *
     * How long it will take to make this change will depend on the current and new revoke delays: if increasing by more
     * than 5 days, then the time difference between the revoke delays must pass. Otherwise, the minimum delay change
     * execution delay of 5 days must pass instead.
     *
     * Only `executors` will be able to execute the scheduled execution, unless `executors` is an empty array, in which
     * case any account can execute it.
     *
     * Avoid scheduling multiple revoke delay changes for the same action at the same time, as this makes it harder to
     * reason about the state of the system. If there is already a scheduled revoke delay change and there is a desire
     * to change the future grant delay to some other value, cancel the first scheduled change and schedule a new one.
     *
     * Only root can call this function, but other accounts may be granted permission to cancel the scheduled execution
     * (including global cancelers).

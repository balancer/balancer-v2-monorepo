# 2023-04-27 - Gauge Working Balance Helper

Deployment of the `GaugeWorkingBalanceHelper`, which reads the current and projected `working_balance` (effective veBAL boosted balance) for a user on a gauge, as well as the ratio of the working_balance to the supply. This can be used (e.g., by front-end processes) to determine whether checkpointing a gauge would be advantageous.

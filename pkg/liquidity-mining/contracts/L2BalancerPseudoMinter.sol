/**
 * @dev Distributes bridged BAL tokens in child chains, using the same interface as the mainnet Balancer minter.
 *
 * This contract is analogous to the mainnet minter: it has the same interface and interacts with (L2) gauges in a
 * similar manner, keeping track of how many tokens were already distributed to each gauge and user.
 *
 * The difference with the mainnet minter is that this contract does not have a way of minting BAL directly: the tokens
 * are only minted in mainnet, and then bridged to L2s. Then, this contract accumulates the emissions received by
 * child chain gauges and distributes them to users.
 *
 * Every time the tokens are 'minted' (i.e. distributed) from a gauge to a given user, the pseudo minter will query the
 * child chain gauge for the total amount of tokes that need to be distributed to that user. By keeping track of the
 * amount that it has already distributed for that gauge / user, the pseudo minter can then transfer the difference
 * to the user and update the total transferred amount.

/**
 * Implement User Balance interactions, which combine Internal Balance and using the Vault's ERC20 allowance.
 *
 * Users can deposit tokens into the Vault, where they are allocated to their Internal Balance, and later
 * transferred or withdrawn. It can also be used as a source of tokens when joining Pools, as a destination
 * when exiting them, and as either when performing swaps. This usage of Internal Balance results in greatly reduced
 * gas costs when compared to relying on plain ERC20 transfers, leading to large savings for frequent users.
 *
 * Internal Balance management features batching, which means a single contract call can be used to perform multiple
 * operations of different kinds, with different senders and recipients, at once.

/**
 * @title Highly opinionated token implementation
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @dev
 * - Includes functions to increase and decrease allowance as a workaround
 *   for the well-known issue with `approve`:
 *   https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
 * - Allows for 'infinite allowance', where an allowance of 0xff..ff is not
 *   decreased by calls to transferFrom
 * - Lets a token holder use `transferFrom` to send their own tokens,
 *   without first setting allowance
 * - Emits 'Approval' events whenever allowance is changed by `transferFrom`
 * - Assigns infinite allowance for all token holders to the Vault

This contract returns the sBTC and SNX which were swept into the ProtocolFeeCollector by the [DoubleEntrypointFixRelayer](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/tasks/20220513-double-entrypoint-fix-relayer/readme.md) as after Synthetix's [Saiph Release](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-saiph-release/) these tokens are no longer affected by the double-entrypoint issue.

This contract is the implementation of Option 1 of the [Decide on Gauge Unexpected Behavior proposa](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x21aaaaeb9343c7876ae6c6aeee2d478237987edf43b7be946c92a947b7186634). It mints BAL needed to make veBAL holders and Polygon and Arbitrum LPs whole, and deprecates the LM committee gauge type.

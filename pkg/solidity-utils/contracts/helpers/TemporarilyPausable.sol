/**
 * @dev Allows for a contract to be paused during an initial period after deployment, disabling functionality. Can be
 * used as an emergency switch in case a security vulnerability or threat is identified.
 *
 * The contract can only be paused during the Pause Window, a period that starts at deployment. It can also be
 * unpaused and repaused any number of times during this period. This is intended to serve as a safety measure: it lets
 * system managers react quickly to potentially dangerous situations, knowing that this action is reversible if careful
 * analysis later determines there was a false alarm.
 *
 * If the contract is paused when the Pause Window finishes, it will remain in the paused state through an additional
 * Buffer Period, after which it will be automatically unpaused forever. This is to ensure there is always enough time
 * to react to an emergency, even if the threat is discovered shortly before the Pause Window expires.
 *
 * Note that since the contract can only be paused within the Pause Window, unpausing during the Buffer Period is
 * irreversible.

# Labelled Accounts

This directory contains accounts which hold permissions over areas of the the Balancer Protocol which aren't deployed as part of the Balancer Protocol itself (as these are tracked in the `@balancer-labs/v2-deployments` package). These are generally Safe multisigs or externally developed contracts.

Balancer DAO maintains documentation on the list of Safe multisigs it uses on [Notion](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/Multisig-List-Guidelines-402e18cff13e4f2fa571bc14ed007546)

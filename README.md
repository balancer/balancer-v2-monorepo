This repository contains Balancer Protocol V2's cores smart contracts, including the `Vault` and different Pools, along with their tests, configuration, and deployments information.

For a high-level introduction to Balancer V2, see [Introducing Balancer V2: Generalized AMMs](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff).

## Structure

This is a Yarn 2 monorepo, with the packages meant to be published in the [`pkg`](./pkg) directory. Newly developed packages may not be yet published.

Active development occurs in this repository, which means some contracts in it may not be production-ready. Proceed with proper care.

### Packages

- [`v2-deployments`](./pkg/deployments): addresses and ABIs of all Balancer V2 deployed contracts, for both the main network and different test ones.
- [`v2-vault`](./pkg/vault): the [`Vault`](./pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol) contract and all core interfaces, including [`IVault`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IVault.sol) and the Pool interfaces: [`IBasePool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IBasePool.sol), [`IGeneralPool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IGeneralPool.sol) and [`IMinimalSwapInfoPool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IMinimalSwapInfoPool.sol).
- [`v2-pool-weighted`](./pkg/pool-weighted): the [`WeightedPool`](./pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool.sol) and [`WeightedPool2Tokens`](./pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool2Tokens.sol) contracts, along with their associated factories.
- [`v2-pool-utils`](./pkg/pool-utils): Solidity utilities used to develop Pool contracts.
- [`v2-solidity-utils`](./pkg/solidity-utils): miscellaneous Solidity helpers and utilities used in many different contracts.
- [`v2-standalone-utils`](./pkg/standalone-utils): miscellaneous standalone utility contracts.

## Security

Multiple independent reviews and audits were performed by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). The latest reports from these engagements are located in the [`audits`](./audits) directory.

Bug bounties apply to most of the smart contracts hosted in this repository: head to [Balancer V2 Bug Bounties](https://docs.balancer.fi/core-concepts/security/bug-bounties) to learn more.

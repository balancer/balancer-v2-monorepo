    // This is not really an interface - it just defines common structs used by other interfaces: IGeneralPool and
    // IMinimalSwapInfoPool.

    // This data structure represents a request for a token swap, where `kind` indicates the swap type (given in or
    // given out) which tells whether the amount sent by the Pool is known or not respectively.
    //
    // `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` are the tokens the Pool will receive and send, respectively. `amount` is the number
    // of `tokenIn` tokens that goes into the Pool, or the number of `tokenOut` tokens that the Pool will send depending
    // on the given swap `kind`.
    //
    // All other fields are not strictly necessary for most swaps, but are provided to support advanced scenarios in
    // some Pools.
    // `poolId` is the ID of the Pool involved in the swap - this is useful for Pool contracts that implement more than
    // one Pool.
    // `from` is the origin address where funds the Pool receives are coming from, and `to` is the destination address
    // where the funds the Pool sends are going to.
    // `userData` is extra data provided by the caller - typically a signature from a trusted party.

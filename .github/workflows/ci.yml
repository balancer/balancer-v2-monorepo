        # Hardhat caches node requests when working with forked networks (e.g. when querying contract code, storage,
        # etc.) to save time in future runs. We cache this directory accross runs.
        # This cache action is special for a couple reasons, which originate from a) it not occupying much disk size,
        # and b) the cache never being invalid (as past blockchain data is immutable). We therefore:
        #  - save the cache even on action failure (which may be caused due to a timeout), even if this could result in
        #    some wasted space. For this we use the always-upload-cache fork of the basic action.
        #  - use a different key on every single run, causing for the cache to always be saved.
        #  - use a wildcard as a restore key, which will cause all stored keys to match and the most recent one to be
        #    selected.
